# ðŸ’¬ FinnoSQL ChatBot : GenAI-Powered SQL Chat Assistant
## An interactive Generative AI-driven chat assistant designed to interpret natural language prompts and execute SQL queries dynamically.
This application enables **financial data exploration** by leveraging **LLM-based prompt parsing** to generate **context-aware SQL** statements. 
It connects to a **Snowflake data warehouse**, executes the queries securely, and returns **structured tabular responses** based on real-time results.

## ðŸ”§ Technical Highlights
- **Natural Language to SQL Translation** using GenAI models

- **Dynamic Query Generation** with semantic understanding of user intent

- **Secure Execution on Snowflake** with parameterized queries"

- **Stuctured Tabular Output Rendering** using interactive UI components (eg, Streamlit, Gradio)}

- **Error Handling & Query Validation** to ensure safe and accurate data access

- **Domain-Specific Optimization** for financial datasets and KPIs


This assistant is ideal for non-technical users, data analysts, or business stakeholders who want to interact with complex datasets without writing SQL manually.
